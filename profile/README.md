## Welcome

The [Research Computing Group](https://www.slu.edu/research/faculty-resources/research-computing.php) at Saint Louis University works with partners 
all around the world, generating well-encoded knowledge, recording academic conversation, and catalyzing human research.

### Clara Fides

Our development team established their legacy with the Walter J. Ong, <small>S.J.</small> Center for Digital Humanities before branching out into 
research software that crosses domains and disciplines. Our oldest active project, [TPEN](http://t-pen.org), has been supported and loved for over a 
decade. We are leaders in interoperable research software, especially for middle-sized organizations who cannot host all their own technology resources, 
but are large enough to be stewards of their own footprints in history. Our ability to create customized software that follows best practices, conforms 
to open standards, and accelerates research has distinguished us from large vendors with one-size-fits-all solutions or large institutions with 
beautiful but walled gardens.

Through transformative and non-destructive annotation, the tools that make up our [Rerum ecosystem](http://rerum.io) are designed to be immediately useful 
to any scholar or developer with many completely open and public services. We connect and interact with universities, libraries, foundations, and 
individuals across the globe, on a mission of recording and sharing our shared human knowledge.

### Work with Us

Almost all of our work is done completely in the open, from the first commit, right here in these repositories. It is all Open Source and we are 
pleased whenever someone contributes. Even corrceting a typo is a welcome PR. If you are a scholar or organization looking for help, reach out via 
email and ask your questions or request a meeting. We have worked on grants from public and private foundations and governments across the arts and 
sciences, as well as subcontracts and just Doing Good. RCG developers play well with other development groups and organizational ITS departments as well, 
serving as consultants, project designers, team leads, architects, programmers, etc. as needed to fill in the skills.
